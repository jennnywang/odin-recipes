    <p>For my own reference:
        <ol>
            <li>An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on google or the <a href='https://www.allrecipes.com' target="_blank">recipe site</a> we linked to earlier.</li>
            <li>Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.</li>
            <li>Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an <strong> unordered list </strong> of the ingredients needed for the recipe.</li>
            <li>Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an <strong> ordered list </strong> of the steps needed for making the dish.</li>

    <h2><b>Homemade Kimchi Recipe</b></h2>
    <h3>Kimchi, a staple food in Korean cuisine, is a traditional side dish of salted and fermented vegetables, such as napa cabbage and Korean radish, 
        made with a widely varying selection of seasonings, including gochugaru, spring onions, garlic, ginger, and jeotgal, etc. 
        t is also used in a variety of soups and stews.</h3>

    <p>Let's simplify this together, and stick to a basic recipe. At the end of  the day, it's spicy fermented cabbage, and it's really really good.   
        Never waste your money on kimchi at the store ever again.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Kosher salt for curing</li>
        <li>1 large napa cabbage</li>
        <li>2 medium sized carrots</li>
        <li>1 small daikon radish</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onion</li>
        <li>1 large asian pear</li>
        <li>6 cloves (20g) garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>2 inch piece ginger, peeled</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup korean red pepper flakes (more or less, as desired)</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Take your napa cabbage and slice in half lengthwise. Cut each of those halves and cut in half again, making quarters. Cut each of those quarters into 1-inch wide strips.</li>
        <li>Take your cabbage and place into a large bowl, heavily seasoning it with kosher salt. Squeeze and toss your cabbage really hard, bruising it. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>    
        <li>While the cabbage is sitting, take your green onions and cut the root bottoms off. Cut the onion into ½-inch segments. Take your carrots and roughly chop them julienne style. Next, peel your medium-sized daikon and cut them like your carrots, but a thicker julienne chop. </li>
        <li> To make your paste, slice your 2-inch segment of peeled ginger and place into a food processor. Peel and chop an asian pear into cubes and add to the processor. Add in 6 cloves of peeled garlic, and a ¼ cup of fish sauce. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Transfer paste to a medium-sized bowl and mix together with korean red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>After your cabbage has been sitting, drain through a colander and rinse with water while squeezing at the same time. Toss and squeeze until you’ve washed off the majority of the salt. </li>
        <li>Add your cabbage and all of the vegetables you cut into a large bowl. From there, add in all of your paste and toss to thoroughly coat. Once evenly coated, pack contents into a ½ gallon glass jar that is large enough to fit the mixture. Using a spoon or muddler, press down all of the vegetables so it is packed together, removing any air bubbles in there.</li> 
        <li>Loosely cap the jar off, making sure you don’t tighten it all the way down (for it to release gas) and let it sit for 4-7 days. Make sure to press it throughout this time to remove air bubbles that form throughout.</li>
        <li>Once your kimchi has reached the desired flavor point, tighten the cap all the way and store it in the refrigerator.</li></li>

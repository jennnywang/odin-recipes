    <h2><b>Pita Bread Recipe</b></h2>
    <h3>Pita or pitta, is a family of yeast-leavened round flatbreads baked from wheat flour, common in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and neighboring areas.</h3>

    <p>This homemade pita bread recipe is easy to make and requires a few ingredients you may already have on hand!  
        Mix up the very simple dough, let it rise, and experience the magic of fresh, warm, perfectly puffy homemade pita bread.</p>
    <p><em>Tip:</em>You can prepare pita dough and store it in the fridge for up to 1 week.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>All purpose flour</li>
        <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup lukewarm water in a large mixing bowl with yeast and sugar. Stir until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup flour and whisk together.</li>
        <li>Place the mixing bowl in a warm (not hot) place, uncovered. Wait about 15 minutes or until mixture is frothy and bubbling a bit</li>
        <li>Now add salt, olive oil, and the remaining flour (keep about ½ cup of the flour for dusting later). Stir until mixture forms a shaggy mass.</li>
        <li>Dust with a little flour, then knead the mixture inside the bowl for about 1 minute incorporating any stray bits.</li>
        <li>Dust a clean working surface with just a little bit of flour. Knead lightly for 2 minutes or so until smooth. Cover and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then knead again for a couple more minutes. The dough should be soft and a little bit moist.</li>
        <li>Clean the mixing bowl and give it a light coating of extra virgin olive oil. Put the dough back in the bowl and turn it a couple times just to coat it a bit with the olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cover the mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then cover it with a kitchen towel. Put the bowl in a warm (not hot) place. Leave it for 1 hour or until the dough rises to double its size.</li>
        <li>Gently deflate the dough and place it on a clean work surface. Divide the dough into 7 to 8 equal pieces and shape them into balls. Cover with a towel and leave them for 10 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>Using a floured rolling pin, roll one of the pieces into a circle that's 8-9 inches wide and about a quarter inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a tiny bit of extra virgin olive oil and wipe off any excess. Working with one pita at a time, lay a rolled-out pita on the skillet and bake for 30 seconds, until bubbles start to form.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, flip the pita over and cook for 1-2 minutes on  the other side, repeat until fully cooked and is toasted as desired.</li>
